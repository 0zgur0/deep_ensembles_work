Datasets to use. 

- Andreasen et al. 2021 use Cifar 10 vs. Cifar 10.1 to do OOD testing 
    - These same authors also use Imagenet- with ImageNetV2, ObjectNet, and ImageNet-R for ood testing . 
    - to get `$\beta(x)$` curves, the authors reference results from two papers: Recht et al. 2018 and Recht et al. 2019: "Do {cifar-10/imagenet} classifiers generalize to {cifar-10/imagenet}?"
